# Building Server-side REST API

Earlier in the week, we had a JavaScript JSON server running, that was created for us. 
Today/tomorrow, we're replacing that with Java Spring Boot.

- We are making a REST API / REST server
- Still making HTTP requests/responses
- Will still handle same types of requests:
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE

## MVC (Model-View-Controller) Design Pattern

- Model - Structure of your data, the *things* in your application
- View - How that data is represented or presented (JSON, text on a CLI, visually on the web, etc)
- Controller - How that data can be accessed/managed
