# Database Design

## Vocab 

Normalization - the way you organize and design your database - tables, columns & relationships - to avoid repetition or redundancy. This improves data integrity. 

For example from today's discussion pulling the artist name out into its own table means that the spelling of the name can't be wrong for only one artwork, which might make it appear to be done by a different artist.
